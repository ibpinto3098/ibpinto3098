<div align = 'justify';'><p>Greetings! Welcome to my portfolio repository! A few introductions about myself, I am an inspiring Data Analyst / Scientist that wishes to focus on various <strong>Supply Chain Functions from Logistics, Warehousing or Inventory Management, and Sales to Consumers.</strong> 
 I have a Bachelors Degree in Industrial Engineering and a Masters Degree in Supply Chain thus the reason why I want to focus in these areas. My goal for this repository is to display my growing skills and my thought process throughout these various areas and projects</p></div>
<h2>List of Projects:</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/ibpinto3098/SuperStore-Sales-Analysis">Super Store Sales Analysis</a>:</h4><p>In this project, you will be able to see how I explored the dataset to find trends, and consumer behavior. I have also dug deeper to find possible issues and problems that the supermarket is experiencing that may need further attention. </p></li>
<li><h4><a href="https://github.com/ibpinto3098/COVID19-and-HDI-Project">Covid 19 and HDI Webscraping Project</a>:</h4><p> In this project, I have conducted webscraping methods to create my own dataset to see the effects of being a developed country and a developing country compared to one another. You will see in this project how I cleaned and extrapolated my own dataset to come up with insights on these statistics.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to look into any of my projects (even future projects) that may pique your interest in the field of Supply Chain combined with Data Analytics / Science.</p><br>
<p>Thank you for your time in going through my profile!</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>I am currently in the process of revamping my prior analysis and planning to add more in the future. There will be several changes along the way but you can inspect a few of my analysis in the Personal Projects repository. My first revamped projected would be the Super Store Analysis pinned in the profile.</p>
